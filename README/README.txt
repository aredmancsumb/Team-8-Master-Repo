Project Name : Star Wars Database search engine
 Team 8 : Maud Werkman, Ricardo Baca, Alexander Redman CST 205, May 14 2018

How to run our code: First one want to be in the “Team-8-Master-Repo” directory then you want to type “FLASK_APP=hello.py flask run” to run on your local host and then you copy and paste this link “ http://127.0.0.1:5000/ ” into your browser. Once you open the Star Wars Database search engine you can type in Star Wars characters, planets, ships, and more to see specific information about what you searched.

Future Work : In the future we would like to have pictures for every possible search so you can see what you’re looking at. Also we would like to add more API’s in future for example a pokemon and marvel API. We were unable to add these API’s in because the star wars API was so hard to format and took so much time. Also, we would want to see if we can use speech recognition to let the user search for something. We worked on that now, but weren't able to figure that out in time. We also want to see if we can add speech recognition to let the user search for something. We have been working on this but we haven't been able to figure this out yet.
